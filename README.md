# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance EDA + Deep Learning

This repository contains a complete, ready-to-run notebook for Assignment II (U21ADP05).

## Files
- `student_performance_EDA.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies

## Data
Place `student-mat.csv` in the same folder as the notebook. If not present, the notebook will auto-generate a synthetic dataset so all steps run end-to-end.

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook student_performance_EDA.ipynb
```

## Notes
Use the real dataset for final submission to maximize marks. The notebook includes 5+ EDA visuals, an MLP model, and evaluation plots (loss/accuracy/CM/ROC).
